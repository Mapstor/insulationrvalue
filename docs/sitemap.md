## STRATEGY NOTES

- **Approach**: Content-driven authority site, NOT programmatic SEO
- **Monetization**: Raptive display ads (primary), affiliate links (secondary)
- **Content creation order**: P1 pages first → P2 → P3
- **URL rules**: No years in slugs. Content references current codes/rebates but URLs stay evergreen.
- **Internal linking**: Heavy cross-linking between sections. Every material page links to relevant comparisons, R-value pages, and location pages.
- **Interactive tools**: Calculators and quizzes are the competitive moat — prioritize these.
- **Keyword data**: Based on 14,700+ unique keywords from Google Keyword Planner (18 batches).
