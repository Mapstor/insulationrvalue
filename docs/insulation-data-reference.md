## 7. POLYISO COLD-WEATHER DERATING — CRITICAL DATA {#7-polyiso-derating}

**THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENTIATING FACTS FOR OUR SITE.**

### The Problem
Polyiso's R-value drops significantly below 50°F mean temperature. This is caused by condensation of pentane blowing agent within the foam cells at lower temperatures.

### Building Science Corporation (BSC) Research Data
Testing by Chris Schumacher and John Straube at Building Science Laboratories:

| Mean Temperature | R-Value/Inch (2" samples) | % of Label |
|---|---|---|
| 75°F (labeled) | R-6.0–R-6.5 | 100% |
| 50°F | R-5.5–R-6.0 | ~92% |
| 40°F | R-4.5–R-5.5 | ~77% |
| 25°F | R-3.5–R-4.5 | ~62% |
| 0°F | R-3.0–R-4.0 | ~54% |
| -15°F | R-3.0–R-3.5 | ~50% |

**Source: BSC Info-502, Building Science Corporation; GreenBuildingAdvisor multiple articles**

### NRCA (National Roofing Contractors Association) Recommendations
- **Warm climates**: Use R-5.6/inch design value
- **Cold climates**: Use R-5.0/inch design value
- Since 2016, NRCA has recommended 5.0/inch for cold climates

### PIMA (Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association) Response
- PIMA argues mean winter reference temperature for most North American climate zones is 45°F or higher (never as low as 40°F or 20°F as sometimes tested)
- PIMA's position: "the phenomenon is overstated because testing conditions are unrealistic"
- Building science community disagrees: BSC's John Straube called PIMA's report "obfuscation"

### Temperature Context
- At -15°F outside and 68°F inside, a 2" layer of polyiso on exterior sheathing has its outer face well below 0°F
- The MEAN temperature through the foam layer depends on its position in the wall assembly
- Polyiso sandwiched between warm interior and cold exterior will have its outer portions performing at reduced R-value
- Thicker polyiso performs slightly better because inner portions stay warmer

### Practical Design Implications
1. **Cold climates (Zones 6–8)**: Consider XPS or EPS instead, or use polyiso only on interior side
2. **Hybrid approach**: Put XPS on exterior (cold side) and polyiso on interior (warm side)
3. **BSC recommendation**: "Use a hybrid insulation approach — install cold temperature-tolerant insulation over top of the polyisocyanurate insulation to increase the mean temperature of the polyisocyanurate"
4. **XPS advantage in cold**: XPS actually improves in cold temperatures (R-5.0+ at cold temps vs R-5.0 labeled at 75°F)
5. **EPS advantage**: Most temperature-stable of all rigid foams — minimal variation hot or cold

### Important Note on Blowing Agents
- Pre-2000 polyiso (HCFC-141b blown): Performed well at cold temps
- Post-2000 polyiso (pentane/CO₂ blown): Cold-weather problem emerged after this transition
- Some manufacturers exploring alternative blowing agents (e.g., Firestone ISOGARD claims better cold performance)
- Kingspan "QuadCore" (hybrid, not standard polyiso) claims R-8/inch — but commercial/industrial only, not residential

**Key**: ci = continuous insulation; NR = Not Required; "R-20+5ci" = R-20 cavity + R-5 continuous insulation

### 2021 IECC Key Changes from 2018 IECC
- **Ceiling**: Zones 4–8 increased from R-49 to R-60
- **Walls**: Added new option "R-0+20ci" (all continuous, no cavity) for Zones 4–8
- **Additional Efficiency Options (AEOs)**: Section R408 now requires 5% better than base levels (2 options from a list)
- **Air leakage**: 3.0 ACH50 for Zones 3–8 (same as 2018); new 5.0 ACH50 max tradeoff limit
- **Attic exception preserved**: Where R-60 is required, R-49 over 100% of area satisfies if full uncompressed R-49 extends over wall top plates at eaves

### 2021 IECC Wall Options (Zones 4-8) — Important for Content
| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| R-20 cavity + R-5 ci | Most common: fill 2×6 cavity + 1" exterior rigid foam |
| R-13 cavity + R-10 ci | Fill 2×4 cavity + 2" exterior rigid foam |
| R-0 + R-20 ci | All continuous insulation, no cavity (less common) |
| U-0.045 max | Performance-based alternative |

### Critical Insight for Content:
**"Wood framing reduces in-cavity R-value by 14–18%"** — Building Enclosure (for wood studs)
**"A 2×6 wall with R-23 in cavities and 23% framing has a whole-wall R-value of only R-18"** — Sterling Lumber/JLC
**"Thermal bridging through framing accounts for 10–15% of U.S. residential energy use"** — Research cited by GreenBuildingAdvisor

### The Case for Continuous Insulation
- Adding even R-5 ci over a 2×6 wall dramatically reduces thermal bridging impact
- R-5 ci added to 2×6 wall: whole-wall goes from ~R-15 to ~R-19 (27% improvement)
- R-10 ci added to 2×4 wall: whole-wall ~R-21 with only 9% thermal bridging loss
- 2021 IECC now requires ci in Zones 4-8 for new construction (first time in code history)

## 12. FIRE SAFETY RATINGS {#12-fire-safety}

### ASTM E84 Surface Burning Characteristics

| Material | Flame Spread Index (FSI) | Smoke Developed Index (SDI) | Class | Combustible? | Melting/Ignition Temp |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mineral Wool (unfaced) | 0 | 0 | Class A | No | >2,150°F (1,177°C) melt |
| Fiberglass (unfaced) | ≤25 | ≤50 | Class A | No | 1,300–1,500°F melt |
| Cellulose (treated) | ≤25 | ≤450 | Class A rated | YES (combustible) | ~400°F untreated |
| Spray Foam (open-cell) | ≤75 | ≤450 | Class C typical | YES | ~700°F |
| Spray Foam (closed-cell) | ≤75 | ≤450 | Class C typical | YES | ~700–800°F |
| EPS | ≤75 | ≤450 | Class C | YES | ~480°F auto-ignition |
| XPS | ≤75 | ≤450 | Class C | YES | ~480–500°F |
| Polyiso (foil-faced) | ≤25 | ≤50–150 | Class A | YES | ~400–500°F |

### Key Fire Safety Rules
- ALL foam insulations (spray foam, EPS, XPS, polyiso) require a **15-minute thermal barrier** (typically ½" drywall or equivalent) when installed in occupied spaces
- Exception: Some polyiso products with integral facers (e.g., DuPont Thermax) are rated for exposed applications without thermal barrier
- Mineral wool is the ONLY common insulation that is truly non-combustible AND has FSI/SDI of 0/0
- Cellulose is treated to be fire-resistant but IS combustible — the borate treatment inhibits flame spread but doesn't make it non-combustible
- Fiberglass doesn't burn but MELTS at 1,300°F — glass fiber itself is non-combustible

## 13. MOISTURE & VAPOR PERMEABILITY {#13-moisture}

### Vapor Permeability Ratings

| Material | Permeance (perms) | Vapor Class | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Polyiso (foil-faced) | <0.05 | Class I (barrier) | Effectively a vapor barrier |
| Closed-Cell Spray Foam (2") | <1.0 | Class II (retarder) | At 1.5–2" thickness |
| XPS (1") | ~1.1 | Class II (retarder) | Moderate vapor control |
| Kraft Paper Facing | ~1.0 | Class II (retarder) | Standard on fiberglass batts |
| EPS (1") | 2.0–5.0 | Class III (semi-permeable) | More permeable than XPS |
| Polyethylene Sheet (6 mil) | 0.06 | Class I (barrier) | Common vapor barrier material |
| Open-Cell Spray Foam | 12–20 | No classification | Highly permeable — NOT a vapor retarder |
| Fiberglass (unfaced) | >50 | No classification | Essentially no vapor resistance |
| Mineral Wool (unfaced) | >30 | No classification | Highly permeable — allows drying |
| Cellulose | 4–6 | Class III | Moderately permeable |
| Smart Vapor Retarders | Variable (1–50+) | Adaptive | Changes permeability with humidity (e.g., CertainTeed MemBrain) |

### Vapor Retarder Classes (per IBC/IRC)
- **Class I** (<0.1 perms): Polyethylene sheet, foil facings, glass — essentially impermeable
- **Class II** (0.1–1.0 perms): Kraft-facing, some foams at sufficient thickness
- **Class III** (1.0–10 perms): Latex paint, EPS, some cellulose
- **Classes not vapor retarders** (>10 perms): Unfaced fiberglass, mineral wool, open-cell spray foam

### Climate-Specific Guidance
| Climate | Vapor Retarder Location | Materials to Use/Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Cold (Zones 5–8) | On warm side (interior) of insulation | Class I or II on interior; exterior must be permeable |
| Mixed (Zones 3–4) | Class III acceptable; smart membranes ideal | Avoid Class I on interior (traps summer moisture) |
| Hot-Humid (Zones 1–2) | On warm side (exterior) in some assemblies | Avoid interior vapor barriers; need outward drying |

## 17. PHYSICS & FORMULAS {#17-physics}

### Core Formulas
- **R-value** = ΔT / Q (temperature difference divided by heat flux)
- **U-value** = 1 / R-value (thermal transmittance; lower is better)
- **R-values are additive**: R_total = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + ...
- **Metric conversion**: R(SI) = R(Imperial) × 0.1761; or R(Imperial) = R(SI) / 0.1761

### Units
- **Imperial (US)**: ft²·°F·h/BTU
- **SI (metric)**: m²·K/W
- **Conversion**: 1 RSI = 5.678 R (Imperial)

### Parallel Path Formula (for thermal bridging)
U_total = (FF × U_framing) + ((1-FF) × U_insulation)
Where FF = framing factor (fraction of wall area that is framing)

R_total = 1 / U_total

### Heat Loss Calculation
Q = U × A × ΔT
Where:
- Q = heat loss (BTU/hour)
- U = 1/R_total
- A = area (sq ft)
- ΔT = temperature difference (°F)
