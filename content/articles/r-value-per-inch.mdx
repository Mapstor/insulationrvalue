# Insulation R-Value Per Inch: Every Material Ranked (2026)

> **Quick Answer:** Closed-cell spray foam delivers the highest R-value per inch at R-6.0 to R-7.0. Polyiso rigid foam follows at R-5.6 to R-6.5 (but drops in cold weather). Standard fiberglass batt sits at R-3.0 to R-3.7 per inch. When space is tight, R-per-inch determines which materials can meet your target — but when you have room, cost per R-value matters more.

## Complete R-Value Per Inch Ranking

We've worked with every material on this list in the field, and the R-per-inch numbers below match what we see in real installations — with one major caveat for polyiso in cold climates (see temperature section below). R-value data is sourced from manufacturer specifications and [DOE insulation fact sheets](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/insulation).

| Rank | Material | R-Value Per Inch | Installed Cost/sq ft | Form | Best Application |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Closed-Cell Spray Foam](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) | R-6.0 – R-7.0 | $1.50 – $5.00 | Spray | Cavity fill + air barrier, limited-depth assemblies |
| 2 | [Polyisocyanurate (Polyiso)](/polyiso-insulation/) | R-5.6 – R-6.5* | $0.70 – $1.50 (material) | Rigid board | Exterior continuous insulation, commercial roofing |
| 3 | [XPS Foam Board](/xps-insulation/) | R-4.5 – R-5.0 | $0.50 – $1.20 (material) | Rigid board | Below-grade, high-moisture areas |
| 4 | [EPS Foam Board](/eps-insulation/) | R-3.6 – R-4.4 | $0.35 – $0.90 (material) | Rigid board | Foundation walls, EIFS, ICFs |
| 5 | [Mineral Wool / Rockwool](/mineral-wool-insulation/) | R-3.8 – R-4.3 | $1.00 – $2.10 | Batt / board | Fire-rated assemblies, [soundproofing](/mineral-wool-insulation/), exterior walls |
| 6 | [High-Density Fiberglass Batt](/fiberglass-insulation/) | R-3.7 – R-4.3 | $0.40 – $1.70 | Batt | 2×4 walls (R-15 in 3.5"), 2×6 walls (R-21 in 5.5") |
| 7 | [Dense-Pack Cellulose](/cellulose-insulation/) | R-3.5 – R-3.8 | $1.50 – $3.00 | Blown (dense) | [Wall retrofits](/wall-insulation/), drill-and-fill |
| 8 | [Open-Cell Spray Foam](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) | R-3.5 – R-3.8 | $1.00 – $3.50 | Spray | Attic rooflines, cathedral ceilings |
| 9 | [Standard Fiberglass Batt](/fiberglass-insulation/) | R-3.0 – R-3.7 | $0.30 – $1.50 | Batt | New construction walls, [attics](/attic-insulation/), budget projects |
| 10 | [Loose-Fill Cellulose](/cellulose-insulation/) | R-3.2 – R-3.8 | $0.60 – $2.30 | Blown (loose) | Attic floors, topping off existing insulation |
| 11 | [Blown-In Fiberglass](/blown-in-insulation/) | R-2.2 – R-2.7 | $0.50 – $2.00 | Blown (loose) | Open attics (installed thicker to compensate) |

*\*Polyiso R-value drops to R-3.5–R-4.5 per inch below 25°F mean temperature. See [temperature effects](#temperature-effects-on-r-per-inch) below.*

Rigid foam board costs listed are material-only. Add $0.50–$1.50/sq ft for professional installation depending on the application. R-values verified against [Owens Corning product data](https://www.owenscorning.com/en-us/insulation/residential) and [Rockwool Comfortbatt specifications](https://www.rockwool.com/north-america/products-and-applications/products/comfortbatt/). For a complete material comparison including fire ratings and moisture performance, see our [types of insulation guide](/types-of-insulation/). For total R-value data and code requirements, see the [R-value insulation chart](/r-value-chart/).

> **Pro Tip:** Blown-in fiberglass ranks last in R-per-inch but don't write it off. In an open attic where depth is unlimited, you simply install it thicker. At 20 inches, it delivers R-49 for $0.50–$2.00/sq ft. R-per-inch only matters when your cavity depth is fixed.

## What Fits in Your Wall Cavity

Stud cavity depth determines your maximum R-value. Here's what each material delivers in standard framing:

| Material | R-Value in 2×4 (3.5") | R-Value in 2×6 (5.5") | R-Value in 2×8 (7.25") |
|---|---|---|---|
| Closed-Cell Spray Foam | R-21 – R-24.5 | R-33 – R-38.5 | R-43.5 – R-50.8 |
| Polyiso Board* | R-19.6 – R-22.8 | R-30.8 – R-35.8 | R-40.6 – R-47.1 |
| XPS Board | R-15.8 – R-17.5 | R-24.8 – R-27.5 | R-32.6 – R-36.3 |
| Mineral Wool Batt | R-13.3 – R-15 | R-20.9 – R-23.7 | R-27.6 – R-31.2 |
| High-Density Fiberglass | R-13 – R-15 | R-20.4 – R-23.7 | R-26.8 – R-31.2 |
| Dense-Pack Cellulose | R-12.3 – R-13.3 | R-19.3 – R-20.9 | R-25.4 – R-27.6 |
| Open-Cell Spray Foam | R-12.3 – R-13.3 | R-19.3 – R-20.9 | R-25.4 – R-27.6 |
| Standard Fiberglass Batt | R-11 – R-13 | R-19 – R-20.4 | R-21.8 – R-26.8 |

*\*Polyiso is rarely installed in stud cavities — it's primarily used as exterior continuous insulation. Values shown for comparison purposes.*

A 2×4 wall maxes out at about R-15 with cavity insulation alone (using high-density fiberglass or mineral wool). To exceed that, you need [continuous insulation](/rigid-foam-insulation/) on the exterior. That's exactly why zones 5+ in the 2021 IECC require cavity + continuous insulation — the code writers know that cavity insulation alone can't hit the target in a 2×4 or even a 2×6 wall.

Use our [R-value calculator](/r-value-calculator/) to model your exact wall assembly, including framing, sheathing, and air films.

## When R-Per-Inch Matters Most

R-value per inch is the deciding metric in two situations, and in our experience, these are the only situations where it should drive your material selection:

**Limited cavity depth.** When you're insulating an existing 2×4 wall, you have exactly 3.5 inches to work with. Closed-cell spray foam gives you R-21+ in that space; standard fiberglass gives you R-11. That's a real difference. Same story for cathedral ceilings with 2×8 or 2×10 rafters — you need to hit R-30 or R-38 in limited depth, which rules out low-R-per-inch materials.

**Retrofit constraints.** Adding insulation to a finished wall without tearing off drywall or siding means working within fixed dimensions. [Dense-pack cellulose](/cellulose-insulation/) at R-3.5–R-3.8/inch is the standard retrofit approach — blown through small holes into the cavity. In a 2×4 wall, that yields about R-13. To get more, you'd need to add continuous insulation on the exterior during a re-siding project. See our [wall insulation guide](/wall-insulation/) for retrofit strategies.

When depth is *not* constrained — open attics, unfinished basements with framed walls — R-per-inch becomes far less important than cost per R-value.

> **Pro Tip:** If you're re-siding your house anyway, that's the perfect time to add 1–2 inches of continuous [rigid foam](/rigid-foam-insulation/) over the sheathing. It adds R-5 to R-13 depending on thickness and material, breaks thermal bridges, and pays for itself in 5–8 years through energy savings. The marginal cost is low since the siding crew is already there.

## Best R-Value Per Dollar

When space isn't the constraint, your wallet is. We typically recommend that homeowners start with cost-per-R-value before considering R-per-inch — especially for attic projects where depth is unlimited. Here's how the materials stack up on cost efficiency, ranked by approximate R-value per dollar per square foot:

| Material | Installed Cost/sq ft | R-Value Delivered (Typical) | Approximate R per Dollar | Value Rank |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard Fiberglass Batt | $0.30 – $1.50 | R-13 (3.5") / R-19 (5.5") | R-13 to R-43 per $ | 1st |
| Blown-In Fiberglass | $0.50 – $2.00 | R-38 (at 16") | R-19 to R-76 per $ | 2nd |
| Loose-Fill Cellulose | $0.60 – $2.30 | R-38 (at 11") | R-17 to R-63 per $ | 3rd |
| EPS Foam Board | $0.35 – $0.90 (material) | R-4/inch | R-4.4 to R-11.4 per $ | 4th |
| Mineral Wool Batt | $1.00 – $2.10 | R-15 (3.5") / R-23 (5.5") | R-7 to R-15 per $ | 5th |
| XPS Foam Board | $0.50 – $1.20 (material) | R-5/inch | R-4.2 to R-10 per $ | 6th |
| Open-Cell Spray Foam | $1.00 – $3.50 | R-13 (3.5") | R-3.7 to R-13 per $ | 7th |
| Polyiso Board | $0.70 – $1.50 (material) | R-6/inch | R-4 to R-8.6 per $ | 8th |
| Dense-Pack Cellulose | $1.50 – $3.00 | R-13 (3.5") | R-4.3 to R-8.7 per $ | 9th |
| Closed-Cell Spray Foam | $1.50 – $5.00 | R-21 (3.5") | R-4.2 to R-14 per $ | 10th |

The clear winners on pure value: [fiberglass batts](/fiberglass-insulation/) for DIY new construction, [blown-in cellulose](/cellulose-insulation/) or fiberglass for attic floors. These materials have been around for decades, and the market keeps them affordable.

Spray foam costs 3–5× more per R-value than blown-in options, but it delivers air sealing, moisture control, and structural reinforcement that cheaper materials don't. You're paying for those additional functions, not just R-value. Check our [insulation cost calculator](/insulation-cost-calculator/) to compare project-specific pricing.

## Temperature Effects on R-Per-Inch

R-value per inch isn't constant for all materials across all temperatures. The FTC tests everything at 75°F mean temperature, but real buildings see much wider temperature swings.

| Material | R/Inch at 75°F | R/Inch at 25°F Mean | R/Inch at 40°F Mean | Temperature Sensitivity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Polyiso](/polyiso-insulation/) | R-5.6 – R-6.5 | R-3.5 – R-4.5 | R-4.5 – R-5.5 | High — loses up to 25% below 50°F mean |
| [XPS](/xps-insulation/) | R-4.5 – R-5.0 | R-5.0 – R-5.5 | R-4.8 – R-5.2 | Slight improvement in cold |
| [EPS](/eps-insulation/) | R-3.6 – R-4.4 | R-3.6 – R-4.4 | R-3.6 – R-4.4 | Most stable — minimal change |
| [Fiberglass](/fiberglass-insulation/) | R-3.0 – R-4.3 | R-3.0 – R-4.3 | R-3.0 – R-4.3 | Stable across range |
| [Mineral Wool](/mineral-wool-insulation/) | R-3.8 – R-4.3 | R-3.8 – R-4.3 | R-3.8 – R-4.3 | Stable across range |
| [Cellulose](/cellulose-insulation/) | R-3.2 – R-3.8 | R-3.2 – R-3.8 | R-3.2 – R-3.8 | Stable across range |

The practical takeaway: if you're in [climate zones 5–8](/climate-zone-map/) and using polyiso on the exterior, derate your R-value calculations by 15–25%. We've seen this firsthand on blower door tests where polyiso-clad walls in Minnesota underperformed the calculated U-factor. [Building Science Corporation's research on rigid foam temperature performance](https://www.buildingscience.com/documents/information-sheets/info-sheet-rigid-foam-insulation) documents this extensively. Alternatively, layer polyiso with EPS — the EPS performs at full R-value in cold, offsetting the polyiso derating. Some builders in northern climates have switched to EPS or XPS entirely for exterior continuous insulation to avoid the cold-weather R-value penalty.

> **Pro Tip:** Building Science Corporation research shows the best cold-climate strategy for exterior rigid foam is "polyiso sandwich" — EPS on the outside (cold side) with polyiso on the inside (warm side). The polyiso stays warmer and maintains its R-value; the EPS handles the cold exposure. It's a niche detail but it can deliver 10–15% more real-world R-value than polyiso alone in zones 6+.

## Thickness Required for Common R-Values

How many inches of each material do you need to hit standard R-value targets? This is the question every installer asks when specifying material quantities.

| Target R-Value | Fiberglass Batt | Blown Cellulose | Blown Fiberglass | Mineral Wool | Closed-Cell Spray Foam | Open-Cell Spray Foam | XPS Board | Polyiso Board |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-13 | 3.5" | 3.5"–4" | 5"–6" | 3"–3.5" | 2" | 3.5" | 2.6"–2.9" | 2"–2.3" |
| R-19 | 6.25" | 5"–5.5" | 7"–8.5" | 4.5"–5" | 2.75"–3.2" | 5"–5.5" | 3.8"–4.2" | 2.9"–3.4" |
| R-30 | 9.5"–10" | 8"–9" | 11"–14" | 7"–7.9" | 4.3"–5" | 7.9"–8.6" | 6"–6.7" | 4.6"–5.4" |
| R-38 | 12"–12.5" | 10.5"–11" | 14"–17" | 8.8"–10" | 5.4"–6.3" | 10"–10.9" | 7.6"–8.4" | 5.8"–6.8" |
| R-49 | 15"–16" | 13.5"–14" | 18"–22" | 11.4"–12.9" | 7"–8.2" | 12.9"–14" | 9.8"–10.9" | 7.5"–8.8" |
| R-60 | 18"–19" | 16"–17" | 22"–27" | 14"–15.8" | 8.6"–10" | 15.8"–17.1" | 12"–13.3" | 9.2"–10.7" |

*Cellulose thickness assumes settled density — install 20% deeper to account for settling over time.*

## Key Takeaways

- [Closed-cell spray foam](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) leads at R-6.0–R-7.0 per inch, making it the go-to for space-constrained applications.
- R-per-inch matters when your cavity depth is fixed (existing walls, cathedral ceilings). When depth is unlimited (open attics), cost per R-value matters more.
- [Fiberglass](/fiberglass-insulation/) and [cellulose](/cellulose-insulation/) deliver the best R-value per dollar — 3–5× more cost-effective than spray foam in open spaces.
- [Polyiso](/polyiso-insulation/) loses up to 25% of its labeled R-per-inch in cold climates. Derate it in zones 5+ or pair it with [EPS](/eps-insulation/).
- A 2×4 wall maxes out at about R-15 with cavity insulation. Exceeding that requires continuous exterior insulation.
- Hitting R-49 for your attic takes about 14 inches of cellulose, 16 inches of fiberglass batts, or 7–8 inches of closed-cell spray foam.
- Don't pick insulation by R-per-inch alone — factor in cost, fire safety, moisture resistance, sound performance, and your specific application.

## FAQ

### What insulation has the highest R-value per inch?

Closed-cell spray foam at R-6.0 to R-7.0 per inch. [Polyiso rigid board](/polyiso-insulation/) is close behind at R-5.6 to R-6.5, but its real-world performance drops in cold weather. For a complete ranking of all materials, reference the chart above or see our full [R-value insulation chart](/r-value-chart/).

### How much R-value can I fit in a 2×4 wall?

A 2×4 stud cavity is 3.5 inches deep. The maximum cavity R-values are: R-21 to R-24.5 with closed-cell spray foam, R-15 with high-density fiberglass, R-15 with mineral wool, R-13 with standard fiberglass or dense-pack cellulose. To exceed R-15 without spray foam, add continuous [rigid foam insulation](/rigid-foam-insulation/) on the exterior of the wall.

### Does R-value per inch change over time?

For most materials, no. [Fiberglass](/fiberglass-insulation/), [mineral wool](/mineral-wool-insulation/), and [EPS](/eps-insulation/) maintain their R-per-inch indefinitely if they stay dry and uncompressed. [XPS](/xps-insulation/) loses some blowing agent over decades and its long-term R-value settles from R-5.0 to about R-4.5 per inch (ASTM C578 accounts for this with LTTR testing). [Cellulose](/cellulose-insulation/) doesn't lose R-per-inch, but it settles ~20%, reducing total R-value unless it was initially over-installed.

### Is higher R-per-inch always worth the extra cost?

No. In open attics, blown-in cellulose at R-3.5/inch installed to 14+ inches is far cheaper than closed-cell spray foam at R-6.5/inch for the same total R-value. High R-per-inch materials are worth the premium only when space is limited or when you need their secondary properties (air sealing, moisture barrier, structural reinforcement). [Energy Star's insulation recommendations](https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate) focus on total R-value targets, not R-per-inch. Run the numbers for your specific project using our [insulation cost calculator](/insulation-cost-calculator/).
