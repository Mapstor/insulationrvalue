# XPS Insulation: R-Value, Moisture Resistance & Buyer's Guide

XPS (extruded polystyrene) is the rigid foam you grab when moisture is the primary concern. At <0.3% moisture absorption by volume, it outperforms every other rigid foam in wet environments — foundations, below-grade walls, under-slab, and anywhere else water or soil contact is involved. The pink boards (Owens Corning Foamular) and blue boards (formerly Dow Styrofoam) at every building supply store are XPS. R-4.5 to R-5.0 per inch, stable to slightly improving in cold temperatures, with compressive strength grades ranging from 15 psi for walls to 100 psi for highway applications. Two honest caveats: R-value declines 5–10% over 10–15 years as blowing agents dissipate, and XPS carries a higher environmental footprint than [EPS](/eps-insulation/).

> **Quick Answer:** XPS delivers R-4.5–5.0 per inch with the lowest moisture absorption of any rigid foam (<0.3% by volume). It's the standard for below-grade foundations, under-slab applications, and high-moisture environments. R-value is stable in cold temperatures (unlike [polyiso](/polyiso-insulation/), which derates 38–50%). Two caveats: R-value drops 5–10% over 10–15 years as blowing agents escape, and its HFC blowing agent has high environmental impact (GWP ~1,430). Cost: $0.30–$0.50/board foot, roughly 2× [EPS](/eps-insulation/).

## R-Value & Temperature Performance

XPS delivers R-4.5 to R-5.0 per inch. Fresh-from-the-factory boards test at R-5.0; the number settles to R-4.5–4.7 as the product ages.

### Long-Term R-Value Aging

| Age | R-Value/Inch | % of Initial |
|---|---|---|
| New (factory) | R-5.0 | 100% |
| 5 years | R-4.7–R-4.8 | ~95% |
| 10–15 years | R-4.5–R-4.7 | ~92% |

**Why it declines:** XPS is manufactured with a blowing agent (HFC-134a, transitioning to HFO and CO₂) trapped in its closed cells. Over time, the blowing agent slowly diffuses out and is replaced by air, which has lower insulating value. ASTM C578 includes Long-Term Thermal Resistance (LTTR) testing to account for this aging.

**The practical impact is modest.** A 5–10% decline over 10–15 years means 2 inches of XPS drops from R-10 to R-9.0–9.4 over a decade. For most assemblies, this is within design margins. Compare to [polyiso](/polyiso-insulation/), which loses 38–50% of its R-value in cold conditions — a much more significant performance gap.

**Temperature stability:** XPS performs well in cold. R-value holds steady or slightly improves as temperature drops — the opposite of polyiso's behavior. This makes XPS the preferred rigid foam for exterior applications in [cold climates](/climate-zone-map/) (zones 5–8) where polyiso derates significantly. [Building Science Corporation's research on rigid foam performance](https://www.buildingscience.com/documents/information-sheets/info-sheet-502-temperature-dependence-of-r-values) confirms this temperature-dependent behavior across all foam types. The [R-value per inch chart](/r-value-per-inch/) shows the comparison.

## Moisture Resistance

This is XPS's defining advantage. At <0.3% moisture absorption by volume, XPS absorbs less water than any other common insulation material.

| Material | Moisture Absorption | Practical Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **XPS** | **<0.3%** | **Negligible — maintains R-value in wet conditions** |
| [EPS](/eps-insulation/) | 2–5% | Moderate — works with drainage, slight R-value reduction |
| [Polyiso](/polyiso-insulation/) | Low (core), but absorbs at cut edges | Not recommended below-grade |
| [Fiberglass](/fiberglass-insulation/) | Traps water | Loses most R-value when wet |

**Why this matters below grade:** Foundation walls and under-slab applications involve direct contact with soil moisture, groundwater pressure, and condensation. An insulation material that absorbs water loses R-value, promotes mold, and deteriorates structurally. XPS's <0.3% absorption means it maintains its thermal performance and structural integrity in these conditions for decades.

**Vapor permeability:** ~1.0–1.1 perms per inch, making 1 inch of XPS a Class II vapor retarder. At 2 inches (~0.5 perms), it approaches Class I territory. This means XPS controls vapor diffusion in addition to resisting liquid moisture — a dual benefit for [basement walls](/basement-insulation/) and [crawl space](/crawl-space-insulation/) applications. The [vapor barrier guide](/crawl-space-vapor-barrier/) explains the Class I/II/III system.

> **Pro Tip:** For below-grade foundation walls, XPS is the only rigid foam we use without hesitation. [EPS](/eps-insulation/) works below-grade too (thousands of ICF foundations prove it), but it needs a drainage plane to manage its higher moisture absorption. XPS doesn't — it shrugs off soil moisture with no performance loss. If your project involves direct earth contact without drainage, XPS is the safer choice.

## Product Grades by Compressive Strength

XPS is manufactured in multiple grades for different structural loads. [Owens Corning's Foamular](https://www.owenscorning.com/en-us/insulation/commercial/rigid-foam) line is the most widely available:

| Product | Compressive Strength | Typical Applications |
|---|---|---|
| Foamular 150 | 15 psi | Above-grade walls, general sheathing |
| Foamular 250 | 25 psi | Below-grade foundations, crawl spaces |
| Foamular 400 | 40 psi | Under-slab residential, parking decks |
| Foamular 600 | 60 psi | Heavy commercial, cold storage |
| Foamular 1000 | 100 psi | Highway sub-base, industrial |

**How to choose:** For most residential projects, Foamular 150 (15 psi) handles walls and above-grade applications. Below-grade foundation walls: Foamular 250 (25 psi) for soil pressure resistance. Under-slab: Foamular 400 (40 psi) minimum — the slab and everything on it bears down on this foam permanently.

All grades deliver the same R-value (R-5.0/inch new, aging to R-4.5–4.7). The difference is compressive strength and price — higher grades cost more per board foot. Common thicknesses: 1 inch, 1.5 inch, 2 inch, and 3 inch. The [insulation thickness chart](/insulation-thickness-calculator/) shows how thickness maps to R-value targets.

## Best Applications

| Application | XPS? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| [Foundation walls](/basement-insulation/) (below-grade) | **Best choice** | <0.3% moisture absorption, soil contact durability |
| Under-slab insulation | **Best choice** | High compressive strength grades, moisture-proof |
| [Crawl space walls](/crawl-space-insulation/) | **Excellent** | Moisture resistance + vapor retarder properties |
| Exterior wall [continuous insulation](/rigid-foam-insulation/) | **Excellent** | Cold-stable R-value, weatherable |
| [Rim joist](/basement-insulation/) (cut-and-cobble) | **Good** | Easy to cut, moisture-tolerant |
| [Roofing](/attic-insulation/) (above-deck) | Acceptable | Works but polyiso preferred in warm climates (higher R/inch) |
| Interior wall applications | Acceptable | Works but polyiso delivers more R/inch at warm temps |

XPS wins anywhere moisture or cold temperatures are factors. For warm-side applications where moisture isn't a concern, [polyiso](/polyiso-insulation/) delivers more R-value per inch and per dollar.

### Foundation Installation Tips

Below-grade XPS installation requires a few specific practices for long-term performance:

- **Apply to the exterior of the foundation wall** before backfilling (new construction) or after excavation (retrofit). The foam goes on the outside of the waterproofing membrane.
- **Use construction adhesive compatible with polystyrene** — solvent-based adhesives dissolve XPS. Look for adhesives specifically labeled for use with foam board.
- **Protect the above-grade portion** with a UV-resistant coating, stucco finish, or metal flashing. XPS degrades in direct sunlight — the surface turns chalky and the R-value of the exposed layer declines.
- **Extend the foam at least 2 feet below grade** (code minimum varies by zone). In climate zones 5+, extending to the footing provides the best thermal performance.
- **Tape all seams** with compatible tape (3M 8067, Siga Wigluv, or manufacturer-recommended) to create a continuous air and moisture barrier.

For existing homes, exterior foundation insulation requires excavation — a $5,000–$15,000+ project. Interior application of XPS against the basement wall is a more cost-effective retrofit approach. Our [basement insulation guide](/basement-insulation/) details both methods.

## Environmental Impact

We present this honestly because it matters to a growing number of builders and homeowners.

**The issue:** XPS is traditionally blown with HFC-134a, which has a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of approximately 1,430 — meaning one pound of HFC-134a traps as much heat as 1,430 pounds of CO₂ over 100 years. This makes XPS the highest-environmental-impact rigid foam by a significant margin.

**The transition:** The industry is actively moving to HFO (hydrofluoroolefin) and CO₂ blowing agents with GWP of 1–3. [Owens Corning](https://www.owenscorning.com/en-us/insulation/commercial/rigid-foam) has transitioned much of its production. By 2025–2026, most North American XPS production uses low-GWP agents. The [DOE's insulation materials overview](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/insulation-materials) covers rigid foam types and their general characteristics.

**For environmentally conscious projects:** [EPS](/eps-insulation/) has the lowest environmental impact of all rigid foams — air-blown, no persistent blowing agents, lowest embodied energy. Graphite-enhanced EPS (GPS) approaches XPS R-values at lower environmental cost. The full comparison is at [XPS vs EPS](/xps-vs-eps/).

## Cost

| Metric | XPS | [EPS](/eps-insulation/) | [Polyiso](/polyiso-insulation/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per board foot | $0.30–$0.50 | $0.15–$0.25 | $0.30–$0.55 |
| Per sq ft (1" board) | $0.50–$1.20 | $0.35–$0.90 | $0.70–$1.50 |

XPS costs roughly double EPS per board foot. The premium buys superior moisture resistance (<0.3% vs 2–5%), higher initial R-value (R-5.0 vs R-3.6–4.4), and built-in vapor retarder properties. Whether the premium is worth it depends on the application — below-grade, it usually is. Above-grade, EPS often delivers adequate performance at substantially lower cost.

**Cost per R-value** is where the comparison gets interesting. XPS at R-5.0/inch and $0.40/bf averages ~$0.08 per R per square foot. EPS Type II at R-3.8/inch and $0.20/bf averages ~$0.05 per R per square foot. So EPS delivers about 40% more R-value per dollar. However, when moisture resistance is the primary concern (foundations, slabs, below-grade), XPS's near-zero absorption justifies the premium — you're paying for moisture performance, not just R-value. In above-grade wall sheathing or roof applications where moisture exposure is manageable, EPS or graphite-enhanced EPS (GPS at R-4.7–5.0/inch) is often the significantly smarter overall value play.

For project-specific pricing, the [insulation cost calculator](/insulation-cost-calculator/) and [cost per square foot](/insulation-cost-calculator/) pages have current data.

> **Pro Tip:** For below-grade foundation walls where XPS is the clear material choice, buy in bulk. A typical basement (1,000 sq ft of wall at 2 inches thick) needs roughly 2,000 board feet of XPS — $600–$1,000 in material. Bulk pricing from building supply stores or direct from distributors can save 15–20% versus buying by the sheet from a home center.

## XPS vs EPS

The most common rigid foam comparison. Brief summary here — the full analysis is at [XPS vs EPS](/xps-vs-eps/).

| Property | XPS | EPS |
|---|---|---|
| R-Value/inch | R-4.5–5.0 | R-3.6–4.4 |
| Moisture absorption | <0.3% (best) | 2–5% |
| Long-term R-value | Declines 5–10% over 10–15 years | **Stable indefinitely** |
| Cost per board foot | $0.30–$0.50 | $0.15–$0.25 (half) |
| Environmental impact | High (HFC blowing agent) | **Lowest** (air-blown) |
| Below-grade | Best choice (no drainage needed) | Good (needs drainage) |

**When XPS wins:** Below-grade without drainage, under-slab, applications where <0.3% moisture absorption is critical.

**When EPS wins:** Budget projects, environmentally conscious builds, applications where long-term R-value stability matters, SIPs and ICFs.

## XPS vs Polyiso

| Property | XPS | [Polyiso](/polyiso-insulation/) |
|---|---|---|
| R-Value/inch at 75°F | R-4.5–5.0 | R-5.6–6.5 (higher) |
| R-Value/inch at 25°F | R-5.0 (stable) | R-3.5–4.5 (drops 38%) |
| Moisture resistance | <0.3% (best) | Low, but absorbs at edges |
| Below-grade | **Yes** | No |
| Cost/board foot | $0.30–$0.50 | $0.30–$0.55 |

**When XPS wins:** Cold-climate exteriors, below-grade, moisture-dominant environments.

**When polyiso wins:** Warm-climate applications, roofing, interior continuous insulation, any location where the foam stays above 40°F.

## Common Mistakes

**1. Using the wrong compressive strength grade.** Foamular 150 (15 psi) under a concrete slab will compress permanently, reducing both R-value and structural support. Under-slab applications require Foamular 400 (40 psi) minimum. Match the product grade to the load.

**2. Not accounting for long-term R-value aging.** Designing an assembly to exactly meet code using fresh-XPS R-values (R-5.0/inch) means the assembly will be below code in 10–15 years when R-value drops to R-4.5–4.7. Use R-4.7/inch for conservative design or add 10% extra thickness.

**3. Choosing XPS over EPS purely on R-value without considering cost.** XPS at R-5.0/inch for $0.40/bf vs EPS at R-4.0/inch for $0.20/bf means EPS delivers more R-value per dollar. For above-grade applications where XPS's superior moisture resistance isn't critical, EPS is often the better investment. Run the numbers at the [R-value calculator](/r-value-calculator/).

**4. Leaving joints untaped on exterior continuous insulation.** XPS boards installed as exterior wall sheathing need taped seams to function as a continuous air barrier and vapor retarder. Untaped joints create air bypass paths and vapor migration points that compromise the entire assembly. Use manufacturer-recommended tape on every joint.

## Key Takeaways

- XPS delivers R-4.5–5.0 per inch with <0.3% moisture absorption — the best moisture resistance of any rigid foam.
- R-value is stable in cold temperatures, making XPS ideal for exterior applications in [zones 5–8](/climate-zone-map/) where [polyiso](/polyiso-insulation/) derates significantly.
- R-value declines 5–10% over 10–15 years as blowing agents dissipate — a modest but real reduction.
- Product grades range from 15 psi (walls) to 100 psi (highway). Match grade to load: 150 for walls, 250 for below-grade, 400+ for under-slab.
- Environmental impact is the highest of rigid foams (HFC blowing agent, GWP ~1,430), though the industry is transitioning to low-GWP agents.

## FAQ

### Does XPS lose R-value over time?

Yes — approximately 5–10% over 10–15 years. New XPS tests at R-5.0/inch; after 10–15 years it settles to R-4.5–4.7/inch as the blowing agent slowly diffuses out and is replaced by air. This is a much smaller decline than [polyiso's](/polyiso-insulation/) cold-weather derating (38–50%), and the [ASTM C578 standard](https://www.astm.org/) accounts for it through Long-Term Thermal Resistance testing. For design purposes, using R-4.7/inch is a safe conservative number.

### Can I use XPS below grade?

Absolutely — below-grade is where XPS excels. Its <0.3% moisture absorption means it maintains R-value and structural integrity in direct soil contact for decades. Use Foamular 250 (25 psi) or higher for [foundation walls](/basement-insulation/) to resist lateral soil pressure. For under-slab, use Foamular 400 (40 psi) or higher for the compressive strength needed under a concrete slab. XPS is the standard recommendation for all below-grade rigid foam applications.

### XPS vs EPS — which should I choose?

XPS for below-grade without drainage, under-slab, and any application where <0.3% moisture absorption is critical. EPS for budget projects, above-grade applications, environmentally conscious builds, SIPs/ICFs, and where long-term R-value stability matters (EPS doesn't age-derate). Full comparison at [XPS vs EPS](/xps-vs-eps/).

### Is XPS environmentally friendly?

XPS has historically been the highest-environmental-impact rigid foam due to its HFC-134a blowing agent (GWP ~1,430). The industry is actively transitioning to HFO and CO₂ agents with GWP of 1–3 — a dramatic improvement. [EPS](/eps-insulation/) remains the lowest-impact rigid foam (air-blown, no persistent agents). If environmental impact is a priority, consider EPS or graphite-enhanced EPS (GPS), which approaches XPS R-values with lower environmental cost.
