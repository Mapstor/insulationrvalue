# Crawl Space Insulation: Encapsulated vs Vented, Materials & Cost

We've pulled thousands of pounds of soggy, moldy fiberglass batts out of crawl spaces — sagging off joist hangers, dripping with moisture, covered in mold. It's the single most common insulation failure we encounter, and it's entirely preventable. Crawl spaces have unique moisture conditions that make material selection critical. The wrong insulation choice doesn't just underperform — it actively damages your home. This guide covers both approaches (encapsulated and vented), the right materials, and why the building science community has largely moved toward encapsulation.

> **Quick Answer:** Two approaches: **encapsulated** (seal vents, install heavy-duty vapor barrier, insulate WALLS with [closed-cell spray foam](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) or [rigid foam](/rigid-foam-insulation/) — the preferred modern method) or **unconditioned** (insulate the FLOOR above, keep vents open — the traditional approach). NEVER use [fiberglass batts](/fiberglass-insulation/) in crawl spaces — they sag, trap moisture, and fail within years. Cost: $1,000–$4,000 for basic floor insulation; $3,000–$15,000 for full encapsulation.

## Conditioned (Encapsulated) vs Unconditioned (Vented)

The industry has shifted decisively toward encapsulation over the past 15 years — and the data supports it. [Advanced Energy research](https://www.buildingscience.com/documents/published-articles) showed sealed crawl spaces reduce energy costs by 15–25% compared to vented crawl spaces and dramatically reduce moisture problems.

| Factor | Encapsulated (Conditioned) | Unconditioned (Vented) |
|---|---|---|
| Insulate where | Crawl space WALLS | FLOOR above (underside of joists) |
| Vents | Sealed permanently | Open (code-required ventilation) |
| Vapor barrier | Heavy-duty (12–20 mil) floor + walls | Basic (6 mil) ground cover only |
| Moisture control | Excellent | Poor (vents introduce outdoor humidity) |
| Freeze protection | Yes (conditioned space keeps pipes above freezing) | No (pipes can freeze) |
| Energy efficiency | Better (smaller envelope, less air leakage) | Worse |
| Pest entry | Reduced (sealed space) | Higher (open vents) |
| Indoor air quality | Better (40–50% of home air rises from below via stack effect) | Worse (moisture, mold spores enter home) |
| Cost | $3,000–$15,000 | $1,000–$4,000 |
| Code | IRC Section R408.3 — allowed in all zones with specific requirements | Traditional default |

**Our recommendation:** Encapsulate. In humid climates (zones 1–4), vented crawl spaces actually introduce moisture — the outdoor air is often more humid than the crawl space air, especially in summer. In cold climates (zones 5–8), encapsulation protects plumbing from freezing and eliminates the floor-above insulation that inevitably sags and fails.

The only scenario where we'd accept a vented crawl space: dry climate, well-drained soil, no history of moisture problems, and no ductwork or plumbing in the crawl space. Even then, a quality ground vapor barrier is non-negotiable.

## R-Value Requirements by Climate Zone

Per the 2021 IECC ([find your zone](/climate-zone-map/)):

| Zone | Crawl Space Wall (if encapsulated) | Floor Above (if unconditioned) |
|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | Not required | R-13 |
| 3 | R-5ci or R-13 | R-19 |
| 4 | R-10ci or R-13 | R-19 (R-30 Marine 4) |
| 5–6 | R-15ci or R-19 | R-30 |
| 7–8 | R-15ci or R-19 | R-38 |

"ci" = continuous insulation (no thermal breaks from framing). For encapsulated crawl spaces, wall insulation R-values are significantly lower than floor requirements — because you're insulating less surface area and eliminating air leakage. The [insulation code requirements](/r-value-calculator/) page has the full IECC tables.

## Encapsulated Crawl Space: How It Works

Encapsulation transforms your crawl space from an outdoor-like environment into a semi-conditioned part of the building envelope. Here's the process:

**Step 1: Address drainage.** If you have standing water or chronic puddles, install interior perimeter drainage and a sump pump first. No insulation or vapor barrier fixes a water infiltration problem.

**Step 2: Install heavy-duty vapor barrier.** Cover the entire floor with 12–20 mil reinforced polyethylene, extending up the walls at least 6 inches above exterior grade. Overlap seams 6 inches minimum and tape with manufacturer-recommended seam tape. Wrap and seal around piers, columns, and any penetrations. Full details at our [crawl space vapor barrier guide](/crawl-space-vapor-barrier/).

**Step 3: Insulate the walls.** Two options:

| Material | R-Value | Cost | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Closed-cell spray foam](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) (2–3") | R-12–R-21 | $2,500–$6,000 | Built-in vapor barrier, air seals, conforms to irregular walls | Expensive, requires pro |
| [XPS](/xps-insulation/) or [EPS](/eps-insulation/) rigid foam (1–3") | R-5–R-15 | $1,500–$4,000 | Cost-effective, DIY-possible, good moisture resistance | Needs mechanical fastening, seams must be taped |

Both options work. Closed-cell spray foam is the premium choice — it air seals, vapor-seals, and insulates in one application, conforming to irregular block or stone walls without gaps. Rigid foam is the budget-friendly alternative that performs well when seams are properly taped.

**Step 4: Seal all vents.** Close, cover, or foam-fill every foundation vent permanently. Seal the rim joist area with [closed-cell spray foam](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) or cut-and-cobble rigid foam (see [rim joist insulation](/basement-insulation/)).

**Step 5: Condition the space.** Supply a small amount of conditioned air from the HVAC system (a single supply register) or install a crawl space dehumidifier sized to maintain 50–55% relative humidity. The space must have a controlled moisture removal mechanism — IRC R408.3 requires this. The [DOE recommends](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/insulation) conditioning all sealed crawl spaces to prevent moisture buildup. [Santa Fe dehumidifiers](https://www.santa-fe-products.com/) and AprilAire are among the most common brands specified for crawl space applications.

> **Pro Tip:** The vapor barrier is the most critical component of encapsulation. A 6-mil poly sheet develops tears and puncture holes within a few years in a working crawl space — anyone who enters for plumbing or HVAC service walks right through it. Spend the extra $200–$400 for 20-mil reinforced poly (Stego Wrap, Americover, or equivalent). It resists punctures, lasts 25+ years, and makes the entire encapsulation more durable. The [DOE recommends](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/insulation) heavy-duty vapor barriers for all crawl space applications.

### Why Encapsulation Is Worth the Investment

The cost of full encapsulation ($3,000–$15,000) is significant, but the benefits extend well beyond energy savings:

- **Energy reduction of 15–25%** — Advanced Energy's field research on sealed crawl spaces in the Southeast showed heating and cooling savings of 15–25% compared to vented crawl spaces with floor insulation.
- **Moisture control** — Bare soil in a crawl space can release 10+ gallons of moisture vapor per day. That moisture rises through the floor via the stack effect and contributes to elevated indoor humidity, condensation on windows, and mold growth in the living space above.
- **Structural protection** — High moisture levels cause wood rot in floor joists, sill plates, and subfloor sheathing. We've inspected crawl spaces where the sill plate was soft enough to push a screwdriver through. A properly encapsulated crawl space keeps relative humidity below 60%, virtually eliminating wood decay.
- **Pest deterrent** — A sealed vapor barrier with taped seams and sealed vents reduces pest entry points. Termites, rodents, and other crawl space pests have fewer avenues into the space.
- **Indoor air quality** — Research indicates 40–50% of the air in a home's first floor originates from the crawl space via the stack effect. Whatever is in the crawl space air — mold spores, moisture, radon, pest droppings — eventually enters the living space. Sealing and conditioning the crawl space directly improves the air quality upstairs.
- **Plumbing protection** — In cold climates, encapsulated crawl spaces protect water supply lines from freezing without heat tape or other workarounds.

### Signs Your Crawl Space Needs Attention

If you notice any of the following, your crawl space is likely contributing to energy loss, moisture problems, or both:

- Musty odors in the house, especially on the first floor
- Uneven floor temperatures — cold spots above the crawl space in winter
- High humidity indoors during summer (above 55–60% RH) despite air conditioning
- Condensation on windows in spring or fall
- Visible mold on first-floor baseboards or subfloor (check from below)
- Sagging or detached insulation visible when you look into the crawl space
- Standing water or damp soil under the house after rain
- Pest activity (termite tubes, rodent droppings) on foundation walls

Any combination of these symptoms points to a crawl space that's actively hurting your home. An energy audit with a blower door test ($150–$350) quantifies the problem and helps prioritize fixes. Check for [other signs of poor insulation](/what-is-r-value/) throughout the home.

## Unconditioned Crawl Space: How It Works

The traditional approach: keep vents open and insulate the floor above the crawl space — the underside of the first-floor joists.

**Material options:**
- **Fiberglass batts** (R-19 to R-30, faced, between joists): The most common approach and the most problematic. Batts are installed with kraft facing up (toward the heated space) and held in place with wire supports or staples. In theory this works. In practice, batts sag from the wire hangers within 2–5 years, moisture from the crawl space compromises the insulation, and the result is a crawl space full of drooping, moldy fiberglass.
- **Closed-cell spray foam** on the underside of the subfloor (2–3", R-14–R-21): Much better. The foam adheres directly to the subfloor, creating an air barrier and vapor retarder. It won't sag, resists moisture, and provides better real-world performance. Cost is 2–3× more than batts.

**Ground vapor barrier is still required** even in unconditioned crawl spaces — 6-mil polyethylene minimum, covering the entire dirt floor.

## Why Fiberglass Fails in Crawl Spaces

This deserves its own section because it's the most common crawl space insulation mistake in America — and we see it every week.

**The problem:** Crawl spaces are damp. Even with ground vapor barriers, moisture levels run higher than any other area of the home. [Fiberglass](/fiberglass-insulation/) traps moisture in the air spaces between its glass fibers. It doesn't absorb water chemically, but it holds it physically — and once wet, fiberglass loses its R-value (a soaked batt may perform at R-1 or less). The moisture promotes mold growth on the paper facing, the wood joists, and the subfloor above.

**The failure progression:**
1. Batts are installed between floor joists with wire hangers — looks great on day one.
2. Within 1–3 years, moisture from below saturates the lower portion of the batts.
3. The wet fiberglass gets heavy. Wire hangers sag. Batts droop and develop gaps.
4. Mold colonizes the kraft-paper facing and spreads to the wood framing.
5. Within 3–7 years, the installation has completely failed — batts hanging in sheets, black with mold, providing zero thermal benefit.

We've removed fiberglass from crawl spaces where the batts weighed three times their dry weight from absorbed moisture. The mold remediation alone cost more than a proper rigid foam or spray foam installation would have.

**The solution:** Use materials rated for high-moisture environments: [closed-cell spray foam](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) (built-in moisture resistance), [XPS](/xps-insulation/) (<0.3% moisture absorption), or [EPS](/eps-insulation/) (workable with drainage). Never fiberglass. Never [open-cell spray foam](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) (12–20 perms — too vapor-permeable for below-grade). For more on moisture and insulation, see [wet insulation](/crawl-space-insulation/) and [mold & insulation](/crawl-space-insulation/).

## Cost Breakdown

### Encapsulation Components (Average Crawl Space ~1,000 sq ft)

| Component | Cost Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Drainage/sump pump (if needed) | $500–$2,000 | Only if standing water issues |
| Vapor barrier (floor + walls) | $500–$3,000 | 12–20 mil reinforced poly |
| Wall insulation (closed-cell spray foam) | $2,500–$6,000 | 2–3" on walls |
| Wall insulation (rigid foam board) | $1,500–$4,000 | 1–3" XPS or EPS, mechanically fastened |
| Dehumidifier or HVAC supply | $500–$2,000 | Required for conditioned space |
| Vent sealing | $200–$500 | Close, cover, or foam-fill all vents |
| **Total (spray foam walls)** | **$4,000–$13,500** | |

### DIY vs Professional

Some crawl space work is DIY-feasible, but most of the high-value items require professionals:

| Task | DIY Feasible? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ground vapor barrier installation | Yes (if accessible) | Uncomfortable but technically simple |
| Removing old fiberglass batts | Yes | Wear full PPE — moldy fiberglass is a respiratory hazard |
| Rigid foam on walls | Moderate | Cutting and fastening foam boards is straightforward, but working in a 3-foot crawl space is physically demanding |
| Closed-cell spray foam | No | Requires professional equipment and training |
| Vent sealing | Yes | Rigid foam cut to fit, sealed with canned foam |
| Dehumidifier installation | Yes | Sized for the space, with proper drainage |
| Interior drainage / sump pump | No | Requires excavation and plumbing expertise |

If you're considering DIY encapsulation with rigid foam and a vapor barrier, budget $1,500–$3,500 in materials for a 1,000 sq ft crawl space. The main challenge isn't the skill level — it's working on your hands and knees in a dark, confined space for 2–3 full days. We've had homeowners start a DIY encapsulation and call us to finish after spending a day in the crawl space. It's harder than it looks.

> **Pro Tip:** If your current crawl space has sagging fiberglass batts, don't just push them back up. Remove them entirely, address any mold or moisture issues on the joists, and re-insulate with closed-cell spray foam or convert to an encapsulated crawl space. Reinstalling fallen fiberglass repeats the same failure — the batts will sag again because the moisture environment hasn't changed.

## Moisture & Vapor Barrier

A ground vapor barrier is non-negotiable in every crawl space — encapsulated or vented. Bare soil in a typical crawl space releases 10+ gallons of moisture vapor per day into the space. That moisture rises through the floor structure into your living space (the stack effect moves 40–50% of indoor air from the lowest level upward).

**Minimum:** 6-mil polyethylene (basic code compliance). **Recommended:** 12–20 mil reinforced polyethylene for puncture resistance and longevity.

Our complete guide at [crawl space vapor barrier](/crawl-space-vapor-barrier/) covers material selection, installation steps, and full encapsulation details. For the broader moisture management picture, the [vapor barrier guide](/crawl-space-vapor-barrier/) explains vapor retarder classes and climate-specific strategies.

**Signs your crawl space has a moisture problem:** musty smell in the house (especially in summer), visible mold or discoloration on floor joists, condensation on ductwork or pipes, cupping or buckling hardwood floors above the crawl space, high indoor humidity that your HVAC struggles to control. If you notice any of these, inspect the crawl space before investing in insulation — moisture problems need to be solved first, or any insulation you install will fail prematurely.

## Common Mistakes

**1. Using fiberglass batts in the crawl space.** We've covered this extensively — fiberglass traps moisture, sags, grows mold, and fails within 3–7 years in the crawl space environment. Use closed-cell spray foam or rigid foam instead.

**2. Open-cell spray foam below grade.** [Open-cell](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) is vapor-permeable (12–20 perms) and absorbs moisture. In a crawl space with constant humidity and potential moisture drive from soil, open-cell fails the same way fiberglass does — just more slowly. Always [closed-cell](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) below grade.

**3. Encapsulating without addressing drainage.** Sealing a crawl space that floods or pools water doesn't fix the water problem — it hides it under the vapor barrier. Address grading, gutter drainage, and install a sump pump BEFORE encapsulating.

**4. Using 6-mil poly for encapsulation.** Basic 6-mil poly tears easily, develops holes from foot traffic during maintenance, and degrades within 5–10 years. For encapsulation, use 12–20 mil reinforced poly that resists punctures and lasts 20+ years. The cost difference is $200–$500 for a typical crawl space — trivial against a $5,000–$10,000 project.

**5. Encapsulating without conditioning the space.** A sealed crawl space without a dehumidifier or HVAC supply can develop even worse moisture problems than a vented one — you've sealed in the moisture with no way to remove it. IRC R408.3 requires a conditioning mechanism for a reason.

If your home has a full or partial basement, many of the same moisture-first principles apply — our [basement insulation guide](/basement-insulation/) covers interior wall methods and the critical rim joist upgrade.

## Key Takeaways

- **Encapsulation is the preferred modern approach:** seal vents, install heavy-duty [vapor barrier](/crawl-space-vapor-barrier/) (12–20 mil), insulate walls with [closed-cell spray foam](/open-cell-vs-closed-cell-spray-foam/) or [rigid foam](/rigid-foam-insulation/), and condition with a dehumidifier or HVAC supply.
- **Never use fiberglass batts** in crawl spaces — they trap moisture, sag, grow mold, and fail within 3–7 years.
- **Never use open-cell spray foam** below grade — it's vapor-permeable and absorbs moisture.
- Encapsulation costs $3,000–$15,000 but reduces energy costs 15–25% and eliminates crawl space moisture problems that damage your home.
- For unconditioned crawl spaces, closed-cell spray foam on the subfloor underside ($2,500–$6,000) outperforms fiberglass batts ($1,000–$4,000) by a wide margin in durability and effectiveness.
- Every crawl space needs a ground vapor barrier — bare soil releases 10+ gallons of moisture per day.
- Address water infiltration and drainage BEFORE insulating or encapsulating.
- 40–50% of indoor air rises from the crawl space via the stack effect — crawl space conditions directly affect indoor air quality.

## FAQ

### Should I encapsulate my crawl space?

In most cases, yes. Encapsulation eliminates moisture problems, protects plumbing from freezing, reduces energy costs by 15–25%, and improves indoor air quality. It's especially worthwhile in humid climates (zones 1–4), homes with moisture or mold history, and crawl spaces containing ductwork or plumbing. The main reason not to encapsulate: budget. Basic floor insulation ($1,000–$4,000) costs less upfront, though encapsulation pays for itself in energy savings and damage prevention over 5–10 years.

### What R-value do I need for crawl space insulation?

Per the 2021 IECC: zones 1–2 R-13 (floor) or no wall requirement; zones 3–4 R-5ci to R-13 (walls) or R-19–R-30 (floor); zones 5–8 R-15ci to R-19 (walls) or R-30–R-38 (floor). Encapsulated crawl spaces use wall R-values (lower numbers, less surface area). Check your [climate zone](/climate-zone-map/) and the [R-value chart](/r-value-chart/) for targets.

### Can I use fiberglass in my crawl space?

We strongly recommend against it. Fiberglass batts in crawl spaces consistently fail within 3–7 years due to moisture — they sag from hangers, trap moisture against wood framing, and grow mold. Closed-cell spray foam or rigid foam (XPS/EPS) are the right materials for this environment. The cost premium is justified by dramatically better durability and moisture performance.

### How much does crawl space insulation cost?

Basic floor insulation with fiberglass batts: $1,000–$4,000 (but expect replacement within 5–7 years). Spray foam on subfloor: $2,500–$6,000. Full encapsulation with spray foam walls: $4,000–$13,500. Full encapsulation with rigid foam walls: $3,000–$9,500. Component breakdowns are above. Use the [insulation cost calculator](/insulation-cost-calculator/) for your project.

### Can I encapsulate a crawl space myself?

A basic vapor barrier installation is a manageable (though uncomfortable) DIY project — tight spaces, dirt floors, and limited headroom. Budget $500–$1,500 in materials. Wall insulation with rigid foam is DIY-possible if you have the patience for cut-and-fit work in a cramped space. Spray foam insulation requires a professional. Full encapsulation including dehumidifier sizing, vent sealing, and insulation is usually best left to a professional crawl space contractor — the cost is $3,000–$15,000 but the quality assurance is worth it for a project that protects your home's structure. If you're considering DIY, start with just the vapor barrier and vent sealing — those two components deliver the most moisture control per dollar and don't require specialized equipment.
